Overall PyDbus Status and Plans  


2017/06/08:

Alpha status. Passes unit testing on centos el 7, python 3.4.
Ubuntu python 3.5, conda/anaconda python 3.6

Supports all glib versions, lifts 2.46 restrictions.

Supports centos and other version/distro combintations that don't ship
with python3 and/or don't ship with dbus introspection support in python.
Watch Travis CI build status for those that interest you. Read the
*.dockerfile for your distro then run.sh to determine if your distro/release
combination needs extra repos and/or rpms/debs.
 

Plans:

Stay current with distro/release updates to ensure all tests continue to pass.
Remove as many dependencies on added / foriegn rpms/debs as possible as the 
distros grow in capability.

Manage dependency hell to verify operation on other distros, use Travis CI to verify unit testing.
Suggestions of which to support next welcome.

Documentation on hcoin/pydbus wiki is complete, TOC is sort of clunky owing to github wiki framework.
Move to 'read the docs' or similar.

Offer paid services to dbus publishers that would like my consulting firm to write translation
specifications for dbus service publishers of their choice.

Add competent authors as committers to broaden support, tweak features
(per access timeouts to override timeout at definition time?)

Determine Lew21's (author pre-translation features) ongoing intrest, 
agree whether to team up and merge back into his repo or proceed
in parallel or independently.
